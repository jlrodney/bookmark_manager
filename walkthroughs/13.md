## Walkthrough – CRUD

[Back to Challenge](../13_crud.md)

**CRUD** is an acronym for the four 'basic functions' of persistent storage:

- **Creating** data
- **Reading** data
- **Updating** data
- **Deleting** data

So far, our application is a CR app. Let's make it a CRUD one.

This walkthrough is in two parts:

- Deleting Bookmarks.
- Updating Bookmarks.

## 1. Deleting Bookmarks

> Prefer to read the code directly? You can check out the entire commit [here](https://github.com/soph-g/bookmark-manager-example/commit/4a4fa9d9338aa152dfe96cf75cbfb87bd387c146).

Here's our requirement:

* Delete Bookmarks

Here's a User Story for that requirement:

```
As a user
So I can remove my bookmark from Bookmark Manager
I want to delete a bookmark
```

Here's the user flow for deleting a bookmark:

1. Visit the homepage.
2. Click a 'delete' button next to a bookmark.
3. See the homepage, without that bookmark.

Here's that flow in Capybara terms:

```ruby
# in spec/features/deleting_a_bookmark_spec.rb

feature 'Deleting a bookmark' do
  scenario 'A user can delete a bookmark' do
    Bookmark.create(url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com', title: 'Makers Academy')
    visit('/bookmarks')
    expect(page).to have_link('Makers Academy', href: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')

    first('.bookmark').click_button 'Delete'

    expect(current_path).to eq '/bookmarks'
    expect(page).not_to have_link('Makers Academy', href: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')
  end
end
```

In this test we are:

1. Setting up test data
2. Checking that the data is present
3. Carrying out the DELETE action
4. Checking that the data has been removed

You can find out more about good steps for setting up and running tests here: [thoughtbot Four-Phase Test](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/four-phase-test).

> I've used Capybara's `first` method to click the Delete button inside the first element with class 'bookmark'.

When we run this test it fails:

```sh
1) Deleting a bookmark A user can delete a bookmark
   Failure/Error: first('.bookmark').click_button 'Delete'

   Capybara::ExpectationNotMet:
     expected to find visible css ".bookmark" at least 1 time but there were no matches
```

This is because we haven't added the bookmark class to the html list item, or the `Delete` button to `index.erb`, yet. Let's do that now:

```html
<ul>
  <% @bookmarks.each do |bookmark| %>
    <li class="bookmark" id="bookmark-<%= bookmark.id %>">
      <a href="<%= bookmark.url %>" target="_blank">
        <%= bookmark.title %>
      </a>
      <input type="submit" value="Delete" />
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

Run the test again, and we have a new fail - this time because this button doesn't do anything. Let's wrap it in a form:

```html
<ul>
  <% @bookmarks.each do |bookmark| %>
    <li id="bookmark-<%= bookmark.id %>">
      <a href="<%= bookmark.url %>" target="_blank">
        <%= bookmark.title %>
      </a>
      <form action="/bookmarks/<%= bookmark.id %>" method="post">
        <input type='hidden' name='_method' value='DELETE'/>
        <input type="submit" value="Delete" />
      </form>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

> We had to do something a bit 'hacky' to delete a record whilst maintaining RESTfulness.  Read more [here](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/114156/why-are-there-are-no-put-and-delete-methods-on-html-forms).

Now our form submits! But 'Sinatra doesn't know this ditty'.

We need to build a route for our Delete button to submit to, in `app.rb`, and enable `:method_override` (if you are using `Sinatra::Base`) so we can use the `DELETE` method. You can find out a little bit more about why this change is needed [here](http://sinatrarb.com/configuration.html)

```ruby
# in app.rb

enable :sessions, :method_override

delete '/bookmarks/:id' do
  # let's print out the form params
  p params
end
```

What do we do in this route? We'd like something like `Bookmark.delete` to happen, and we need to know which bookmark to delete. Handily, we can get this information from the params, when the test is run you should see something like this in the output:

```
{"id"=>"1", "_method" => "DELETE"}
```

We can use this to write the SQL to delete the bookmark with that ID, and redirect:

```ruby
# in app.rb

delete '/bookmarks/:id' do
  connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager_test')
  connection.exec("DELETE FROM bookmarks WHERE id = #{params['id']}")
  redirect '/bookmarks'
end
```

Now that our test passes, let's move the SQL into the `Bookmark` model. Start with a spec for `Bookmark.delete`:

```ruby
# in spec/bookmark_spec.rb

describe '.delete' do
  it 'deletes the given bookmark' do
    bookmark = Bookmark.create(title: 'Makers Academy', url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')

    Bookmark.delete(id: bookmark.id)

    expect(Bookmark.all.length).to eq 0
  end
end
```

And code that looks something like:

```ruby
# in lib/bookmark.rb

class Bookmark
  def self.delete(id:)
    if ENV['ENVIRONMENT'] == 'test'
      connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager_test')
    else
      connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager')
    end
    connection.exec("DELETE FROM bookmarks WHERE id = #{id}")
  end

  ### rest of the class ###
end
```

Our unit test passes, so we can rewrite the controller action:

```ruby
# in app.rb

delete '/bookmarks/:id' do
  Bookmark.delete(id: params[:id])
  redirect '/bookmarks'
end
```

All tests pass: we've delivered the feature!

## Update Bookmarks

As always, our flow is:

- Requirement
- User Story
- Feature Test
- Unit Tests
- Implementation
- Refactoring

> Prefer to read the code directly? You can check out the entire commit [here](https://github.com/soph-g/bookmark-manager-example/commit/ab9cf671f311ee3d0c4cf0cc58cfb1b4f5823a7c).

Here's our requirement:

* Update Bookmarks

Here's a User Story for that requirement:

```
As a user
So I can change a bookmark in Bookmark Manager
I want to update a bookmark
```

Here's the user flow for deleting a bookmark:

1. Visit the 'update bookmark' form for a particular bookmark.
2. Fill in the form with new data – say, a new title – and submit it.
3. See the homepage, with the updated bookmark title (and the old one is gone).

Here's that flow in Capybara terms:

```ruby
# in spec/features/updating_a_bookmark_spec.rb

feature 'Updating a bookmark' do
  scenario 'A user can update a bookmark' do
    bookmark = Bookmark.create(url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com', title: 'Makers Academy')
    visit('/bookmarks')
    expect(page).to have_link('Makers Academy', href: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')

    first('.bookmark').click_button 'Edit'
    expect(current_path).to eq "/bookmarks/#{bookmark.id}/edit"

    fill_in('url', with: "http://www.snakersacademy.com")
    fill_in('title', with: "Snakers Academy")
    click_button('Submit')

    expect(current_path).to eq '/bookmarks'
    expect(page).not_to have_link('Makers Academy', href: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')
    expect(page).to have_link('Snakers Academy', href: 'http://www.snakersacademy.com')
  end
end
```

> I've decided to make use of Sinatra's [named parameters](http://sinatrarb.com/intro.html) for this route: so visiting `/bookmarks/1/edit` will allow the user to update a bookmark with an ID of 1, and so on.

Let's add the button to the bookmarks view:
```html
<!-- in views/bookmarks/index.erb -->

<ul>
  <% @bookmarks.each do |bookmark| %>
    <li class="bookmark" id="bookmark-<%= bookmark.id %>">
      <a href="<%= bookmark.url %>" target="_blank">
        <%= bookmark.title %>
      </a>
      <form action="/bookmarks/<%= bookmark.id %>" method="post">
        <input type='hidden' name='_method' value='DELETE'/>
        <input type="submit" value="Delete" />
      </form>
      <form action="/bookmarks/<%= bookmark.id %>/edit" method="get">
        <input type="submit" value="Edit" />
      </form>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

Let's define a route for this url:

```ruby
# in app.rb

get '/bookmarks/:id/edit' do
  @bookmark_id = params[:id]
  erb :'bookmarks/edit'
end
```

Notice that `bookmark_id` is taken from the params and made into an instance variable - why is this needed?

And a view with the form:

```html
<!-- in views/bookmarks/edit.erb -->

<form action="/bookmarks/<%= @bookmark_id %>" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PATCH" />
  <input type="text" name="url" />
  <input type="text" name="title" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

And another route, to which this form submits:

```ruby
patch '/bookmarks/:id' do
  p params
  redirect('/bookmarks')
end
```

Our test now fails because, although we have all the right routes and views, we're not doing anything to the database in any of them:

```
Failures:

  1) Updating a bookmark A user can update a bookmark
     Failure/Error: expect(page).not_to have_link('Makers Academy', href: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')
       expected not to find visible link "Makers Academy", found 1 match: "Makers Academy"
```

Working backwards, we'd like our `post` action to `/bookmarks/:id/edit` route to do actually update a bookmark. To update a bookmark, we need the ID of the bookmark we're trying to update, this is included in the params because it is part of the route. The updated `url` and `title` are passed in through the form.

We're ready to update the `/bookmarks/:id/edit` route with the SQL required to connect to the database, and update the appropriate record:

```ruby
# in app.rb

patch '/bookmarks/:id' do
  connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager_test')
  connection.exec("UPDATE bookmarks SET url = '#{params[:url]}', title = '#{params[:title]}' WHERE id = '#{params[:id]}'")

  redirect('/bookmarks')
end
```

Our test now passes. Time to refactor!

The first obvious refactor is to push the updating SQL into the model, using TDD you should end up with tests similar to this:

```ruby
# in spec/bookmark_spec.rb

describe '.update' do
  it 'updates the bookmark with the given data' do
    bookmark = Bookmark.create(title: 'Makers Academy', url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')
    updated_bookmark = Bookmark.update(id: bookmark.id, url: 'http://www.snakersacademy.com', title: 'Snakers Academy')

    expect(updated_bookmark).to be_a Bookmark
    expect(updated_bookmark.id).to eq bookmark.id
    expect(updated_bookmark.title).to eq 'Snakers Academy'
    expect(updated_bookmark.url).to eq 'http://www.snakersacademy.com'
  end
end
```

We can solve this by moving the controller SQL into the bookmark model:

```ruby
# in lib/bookmarks.rb

def self.update(id:, url:, title:)
  if ENV['ENVIRONMENT'] == 'test'
    connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager_test')
  else
    connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager')
  end
  result = connection.exec("UPDATE bookmarks SET url = '#{url}', title = '#{title}' WHERE id = #{id} RETURNING id, url, title;")
  Bookmark.new(id: result[0]['id'], title: result[0]['title'], url: result[0]['url'])
end
```

And replacing the controller SQL with the call to the Bookmark model:

```ruby
# in app.rb

patch '/bookmarks/:id' do
    Bookmark.update(id: params[:id], title: params[:title], url: params[:url])
    redirect '/bookmarks'
  end
```

Secondly: **wouldn't it be nice** if our user could see the current data in the `edit` form.

To do this, we need to pass more than just `@bookmark_id` to the form. We need to pass a `Bookmark` object that wraps the data for that bookmark. We've got `Bookmark.all` to pull all bookmarks from the database: we need some way of pulling one Bookmark out. Here's how it could work in the controller:

```ruby
# in app.rb

get '/bookmarks/:id/edit' do
  @bookmark = Bookmark.find(id: params[:id])
  erb :"bookmarks/edit"
end
```

Let's write a `Bookmark.find` method to do that.

```ruby
# in spec/bookmark_spec.rb

describe '.find' do
    it 'returns the requested bookmark object' do
      bookmark = Bookmark.create(title: 'Makers Academy', url: 'http://www.makersacademy.com')

      result = Bookmark.find(id: bookmark.id)

      expect(result).to be_a Bookmark
      expect(result.id).to eq bookmark.id
      expect(result.title).to eq 'Makers Academy'
      expect(result.url).to eq 'http://www.makersacademy.com'
    end
  end
```

Here's the implementation in `Bookmark`:

```ruby
# in lib/bookmark.rb

class Bookmark
  def self.find(id:)
    if ENV['ENVIRONMENT'] == 'test'
      connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager_test')
    else
      connection = PG.connect(dbname: 'bookmark_manager')
    end
    result = connection.exec("SELECT * FROM bookmarks WHERE id = #{id};")
    Bookmark.new(id: result[0]['id'], title: result[0]['title'], url: result[0]['url'])
  end

  ### rest of the class ###
end
```

> Just like with `Bookmark.all`, we have to use the ORM pattern to wrap the bookmark data in a useful Ruby object.

Now we can use this `Bookmark` object in our form. We can set the `value` attribute of each input to the current value of the `bookmark`:

```html
<!-- in views/bookmarks/edit.erb -->

<form action="/bookmarks/<%= @bookmark.id %>" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="PATCH" />
  <input type="text" name="url" value="<%= @bookmark.url %>" />
  <input type="text" name="title" value="<%= @bookmark.title %>" />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

Now when a user visits the form, this is what they see:

![A form pre-filled with the current bookmark data](../images/form-with-values.png)

Now, when a user updates a bookmark, it feels much more like they're 'editing the data' for that bookmark.

Congratulations, you now have a working CRUD application!
